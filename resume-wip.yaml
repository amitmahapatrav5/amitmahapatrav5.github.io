    highlights:
      - "This poc aimed to replace inefficient, error-prone, form-based EHS incident reporting with a GenAI-driven conversational interface to reduce data rework, improve adoption, and lower SaaS licensing costs while scaling access to all employees and contractors."
      - "Designed and developed the backend using Azure OpenAI with LangChain and LangGraph to orchestrate conversational workflows; implemented robust Guardrails AI for input/output validation (hallucination, bias, toxicity), Qdrant for vector-based retrieval and validation, and FastAPI with Pydantic for secure, high-performance REST services; integrated Azure AD SSO for authentication, enabled end-to-end observability and tracing with LangSmith, and ensured reliable, scalable record creation through asynchronous API integrations."
      - "Achieved target scale of >5000 Good Saves/month, enabled ~70% reduction in license costs, reduced data errors to <5%, and delivered 90% successful API submissions with <2-second response time, significantly improving user experience, data quality, and operational efficiency."
